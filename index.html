    <h3> How to give Bone Man your Bones (does NOT work if u don't have an iphone)</h3>
    <p>
      Go to the secret hole in the nearest small town near you! Every small town has one right next to the City Hall. Drop a rope ladder (prefferably white, but any color 
      will do) into the hole and then climb in. Inside you will find a small wooden door, that you must duck to enter, no matter your height. Inside you will find piles 
      upon piles of bones. Do not touch them. You will find that the bones have made a maze, with small walkways inbetween the piles. At the end of the maze, you will 
      find a  room with a small fridge (the food is not rotten, do not worry) inside and a bathroom, and a bed. Once you leave the door at the other end of the room, you
      cannot go back. Also, if you have had any traveling companions with you, they will not be with you at the time, but will return after the next room, where you must
      gather blood from your body, and place it in the altar. Do not listen to the voice. Do as the scroll says. After that, you must exit the room, no matter what the 
      scroll says, or the lion. You will wake up with your phone in your hand, and a new text message. Do as it says
